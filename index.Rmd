Welcome to my website!

#### My name is Priya Singh Collins and as of Saturday, May 7th, I will be a graduate from the University of South Florida. I studied for three years here as a psychology student with a minor in criminology, and will be graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in psychology.

#### Post-graduation, I plan to pursue a career in counseling by applying to and completing a Master's program, getting licensed, and becoming a counselor. During or after my journey to become a counselor, I will be applying to Clinical Psychology PhD programs.
